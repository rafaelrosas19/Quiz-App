# Quiz-App

## Description

The goal of this application was to allow users to answer a series of coding related questions while keeping track of their correct or incorrect responses. Ultimately, each user has a final score and it is saved in local storage. These scores are then reflected in the leaderboard. 

## Installation

To install this repository just follow your basic ssh clone procedure and use whichever text editor you like. It is completely up to you. This is the live application link

## Usage

The app will begin once the user clicks the start quiz button. From there they will have an alloted time of 100 seconds to complete the multiple choice quiz. 
If they do not finish the the quiz in the alloted time then they will reach the end screen and will be asked to try again. If the user finishes the quiz they will receive a score out of 40 points and can decide to save their initials to put on the leaderboard. 

## Credits 

I would like to give credit for an online tutorial that I saw by James Q Quick. It was informative and taught me a lot about how to create my app to fit my style and have certain features that I wanted to implement.
